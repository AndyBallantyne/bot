This directory contains lists of Validation test cases 
to be tested by the validationbot mode of firebot.
Currently there are two lists; pass1 contains test cases that should
succeed and fail1 contains at least one set of test cases that fails.  To run 
the validationbot mode of firebot type:


1. ./run_firebot.sh -c -u -V 8 -D vblists/pass1
2. ./run_firebot.sh -c -u -V 8 -D vblists/fail1

These commands clean and update the repo then runs 8 processes 
using a list of cases  fouind in the directory vblists.

This directory also contains an old version of firbot named
validationbotOLD.sh that contains code implementing validationbot
and TEST directories for use by validationbot.
